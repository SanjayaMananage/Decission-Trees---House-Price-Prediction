# Decission-Trees---House-Price-Prediction

In this project I consider the California Housing Data (1990) set([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/housing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/housing)). This data set is created for prediction of median_house_value of California Housings. The data set consists of 10 predictor variables with a sample size of 20433. I take median_house_value as the quantitative response variable. Among the predictors, ocean_proximity is a qualitative variable and treat others as quantitative variables. I consider all the data as training data. 

Additionally for all the models, I use 5-Fold cross-validation to compute the estimated test MSE.
